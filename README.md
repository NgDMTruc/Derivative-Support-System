# Derivative Prices Forecast with Finance Assistant Question Answer System

This project combines machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) to forecast derivative prices and build a Finance Assistant Question Answer System. The project is organized into three branches, each focusing on a specific aspect of the system.

## Branches

### 1. **ML-DL**
This branch contains code for the **Derivative Prices Forecast** module. It focuses on implementing and training machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to predict derivative price movements.

### 2. **Data**
This branch contains code for creating and preprocessing data for the **Assistant Question Answer System** module. It includes:
- Using synthesis data to check if llm can do price prediction.
- Question-answer pair generation.
- Embedding creation and storage using FAISS.

### 3. **LLM**
This branch contains code for:
- **Fine-tuning** large language models (LLMs) for the Assistant Question Answer System.
- **Evaluating** the performance of the fine-tuned models.
- **Testing** the system with real-world scenarios to ensure reliability and accuracy.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and switch to the desired branch based on your area of interest.
2. Follow the specific instructions in each branch's README to set up and execute the code.

## Goals
- Develop a robust model for derivative price forecasting.
- Create a reliable Assistant Question Answer System for financial applications.
- Integrate LLM capabilities for accurate and contextual responses.

## Acknowledgments
This project leverages state-of-the-art ML/DL techniques and advanced LLM models to push the boundaries of AI in financial applications.
